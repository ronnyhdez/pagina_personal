I'm a Data Professional at [ixpantia](https://www.ixpantia.com/) where I help
organizations gain insigths from their data, develop data products, learn 
R and obtain the best practices for data science. 

[I'm RStudio certified trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/hernandez+ronny/), I like to teach , share and collaborate with others so I co-organize events
with [DataLatam](http://www.datalatam.com/) or by my own.
