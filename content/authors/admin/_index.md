I'm a Data Professional at [ixpantia](https://www.ixpantia.com/) were I help
organizations to get insigths from their data, to develop data products, learn 
R and get the best practices for data science. 

Also I like to teach, share and collaborate with others so I co-organize events
with [DataLatam](http://www.datalatam.com/) or by my own.
