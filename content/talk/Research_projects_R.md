Ongoing research projects files can be easily messed up and in science this can give us 
a hard time. On this workshop you will learn how to organize your files, from data and code to your communication files. Also we will explore some of the newest R packages to manage your data with easy to
read code that allows us to reproduce, automatice and communicate your statistical analysis.

Talk material (slides/code) on my [github account](https://github.com/ronnyhdez/Research-Projects-with-R).
