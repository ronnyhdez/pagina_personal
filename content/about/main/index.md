  I'm biologist who started using R around 2012 during my undergrad studies to analyze images and the tropical forests structural complexity. Also I co-founded a R user group to organize workshops and teach R to students at the Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica.
  
  This interest in R eventually landed me at [ixpantia](https://www.ixpantia.com/en/), where I started using it professionally to develop data solutions for different companies across Latin America and US. I have been working developing models, task automatization, API's or developing and deploying shiny apps.
  
  Since joining ixpantia I have given some talks for [Data Latam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq0bcy4DCDg&list=PLbkT9rzmAYMWP-bhEvnjv3Y_YmbzRFWgP) and contribute to open source packages as [lacramr](https://ixpantia.github.io/lacrmr/), [gitear](https://ixpantia.github.io/gitear/), [introR](https://ixpantia.github.io/introR/), [ixplorer](https://ixpantia.github.io/ixplorer/) and even writting a book about [DataOps](https://connect.ixpantia.com/gpcd/)
