I like to collaborate with biologists, scientists or people from other careers with workshops about the use of R programming language, R with statistics and git (control version system)

Some of my workshops are:

- Comparaciones entre grupos: T-test y ANOVA en R
- ¿Cómo R lee y almacena datos? Estructuras y clases en R
- Manejo de datos y programación en R: Una introducción a R


This workshops can be done in spanish or english, remote or in a specific location. If you are interested please contact me.
