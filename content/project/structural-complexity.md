Analysis of vegetation has intrigued forestry scientists and ecologists for decades. In tropical forests, the interpretation of the wide heterogeneity of their structure and our tropical forests still lack indicators or guidance that represent the great diversity and structural complexity that they possess.  

A new attempt has emerged with the use of digital images that allow spatiotemporal analyses as indicators of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the structure and analyze the patterns of the components photographed (shapes, texture, arrays and colors of the pixels). In this study, we analyze thousands of photographs taken in the subsoil of various types of forests in the Peninsula of Osa, Costa Rica. These flat digital photos were obtained with time-lapse cameras, programmed at intervals defined in four microenvironments typical of tropical rainforest: primary forest, hillside forest, riparian forest and secondary forest.

Spatial heterogeneity indices such as Mean Information Gain (MIG) and Spatial Anisotropy (A) were calculated to correlate aspects of the composition, structural complexity and geometric pattern of the internal canopy in the period between February and December 2015. We found a temporal variation in the MIG value and spatial anisotropy throughout the year. Mean MIG values show a tendency to decrease during the period in all microenvironments. MIG values vary throughout the day being greater than 12:00 and the lowest values at 8:00 AM and 3:00 PM. 

The MIG and spatial anisotropy values show a moderate to a low relation with some classic forest parameters of the structure and geometry of the habitats, whose seems fairly related from each other. The results show that this methodology is sensitive and useful to variations in the composition and structure of the forests, which allows the monitoring of dynamics in time and space. However, there is room to increase efforts to discern possible structural and functional details that seem to define the tremendous spatial heterogeneity found in the forests of the Osa Peninsula.
