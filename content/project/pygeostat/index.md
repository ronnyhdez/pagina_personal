### What is pygeostat?

pygeostat is a scientific Python package designed to support geostatistical
analysis and spatial modeling in research and applied settings. It provides
tools for working with spatial datasets, performing exploratory analysis, and
supporting reproducible geostatistical workflows. 

The package has been used in academic and industry contexts for several years
and represents a mature codebase with an established user community.

### My role

I am currently involved in the ongoing maintenance and modernization of
pygeostat. This work focuses on improving the long-term sustainability of the
project rather than adding new features.

My contributions include:
- Modernizing the packaging and development workflow
- Improving and restructuring the documentation
- Aligning the codebase with current Python and open-source best practices
- Supporting reproducible and maintainable geostatistical workflows
